 * array are 0-indexed linear data structures that store indexed collection of homogenous data types.

 *
 * arrays support following operations:
 *
 * 1. access - using indexes which provide you value store at that index.
 * first value = 0 and last value = n - 1 (with n being the size of array)
 *
 * 2. insert = can be inserted at last position or any position but order
 * needs to be taken care of
 *
 * 3. delete - various methods available but most commonly, swap the
 * index of the index to be deleted with the last one if the order does
 * matter. then decrease size
 *
 * 4. traverse - most commonly using for loop
